MAIN.PY            It is my first phyton project.
This small script was created to practice Python fundamentals like variables, inputs, and conditional logic (if/else). It calculates the total cost of an item and applies a special discount if a condition is met (e.g., training for more than 1 year).
To run this script, please input the price and the time spent training when prompted.

# MadLibs Story Generator (My Second Python Project)

**Project Name:** `MadLibs_Story_Generator`

### Project Description

This is a small, interactive Python script that generates a funny story based on user input. 

It was built to practice and demonstrate the fundamental concepts of:

1.  **Input:** Collecting different types of data (nouns, adjectives, verbs) from the user.
2.  **Variables:** Storing the input data (e.g., `name`, `city`, `food`).
3.  **f-Strings:** Using formatted strings (`f"..."`) to cleanly integrate variables into the story text.

### How to Run the Script

1.  Make sure you have **Python** installed on your system.
2.  Download the `main.py` file.
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5.  Run the script using the command: `python main.py`

### Learning Goal Achieved

This project successfully reinforced the core concepts of **user interaction** and **basic text formatting** in Python.

**Current Status:** Working on project structure (Functions: `def`) in future versions.

*Part of my long-term goal to study Computer Science in the USA.*

# Circle Area Calculator (Fl√§chenrechner)

**Project Goal:** Calculate the area of a circle and practice input validation.

### Key Features

* **Input Validation (`if/else`):** Checks if the user enters a radius greater than zero.
* **Math Library:** Uses the `import math` function to access the constant PI.
* **Float Input:** Handles decimal numbers correctly.
* **Formula:** Calculates the area using the formula: $A = \pi \cdot r^2$.

### Development Note (Future Focus)

The next step is to reorganize the code using **Python Functions (`def`)** to improve structure and reusability.
