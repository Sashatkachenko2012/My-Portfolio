main.py
It is my first phyton project.
This small script was created to practice Python fundamentals like variables, inputs, and conditional logic (if/else). It calculates the total cost of an item and applies a special discount if a condition is met (e.g., training for more than 1 year).
To run this script, please input the price and the time spent training when prompted.
