MAIN.PY            It is my first phyton project.
This small script was created to practice Python fundamentals like variables, inputs, and conditional logic (if/else). It calculates the total cost of an item and applies a special discount if a condition is met (e.g., training for more than 1 year).
To run this script, please input the price and the time spent training when prompted.

# MadLibs Story Generator (My Second Python Project)

**Project Name:** `MadLibs_Story_Generator`

### Project Description

This is a small, interactive Python script that generates a funny story based on user input. 

It was built to practice and demonstrate the fundamental concepts of:

1.  **Input:** Collecting different types of data (nouns, adjectives, verbs) from the user.
2.  **Variables:** Storing the input data (e.g., `name`, `city`, `food`).
3.  **f-Strings:** Using formatted strings (`f"..."`) to cleanly integrate variables into the story text.

### How to Run the Script

1.  Make sure you have **Python** installed on your system.
2.  Download the `main.py` file.
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5.  Run the script using the command: `python main.py`

### Learning Goal Achieved

This project successfully reinforced the core concepts of **user interaction** and **basic text formatting** in Python.

**Current Status:** Working on project structure (Functions: `def`) in future versions.

*Part of my long-term goal to study Computer Science in the USA.*

# Circle Area Calculator (Flächenrechner)

**Project Goal:** Calculate the area of a circle and practice input validation.

### Key Features

* **Input Validation (`if/else`):** Checks if the user enters a radius greater than zero.
* **Math Library:** Uses the `import math` function to access the constant PI.
* **Float Input:** Handles decimal numbers correctly.
* **Formula:** Calculates the area using the formula: $A = \pi \cdot r^2$.

### Development Note (Future Focus)

The next step is to reorganize the code using **Python Functions (`def`)** to improve structure and reusability.

# Circle Area Calculator V2.0

### Core Achievement

First project to successfully implement **Functions (`def`)** for clean code structure.

### Key Concepts

* **Modular Code:** Calculation logic separated into a dedicated function.
* **Error Handling:** Uses `if/else` for input validation (radius > 0).
* **Libraries:** Utilizes `import math` for π.

# Academic Grade Tracker (Project 5)

**Project Goal:** To calculate the accurate average grade from a collection of recorded grades.

### Core Achievement: Data Handling & Automation

This project marks the critical shift from sequential coding to **structured data analysis** by demonstrating mastery of the three foundational pillars of modern programming:

1.  **Automation (For Loop):** The script uses a `for loop` to efficiently iterate through the entire grade list, performing the summation automatically. This technique is fundamental to Big Data and Machine Learning.
2.  **Data Structure (Lists):** Grades are stored in a `list` (`[1.0, 1.3, 2.0]`), proving the ability to manage and store collections of data.
3.  **Modular Code (Functions):** The entire calculation logic is contained within a dedicated function (`def calculate_average`), ensuring the code is reusable, clean, and organized (Separation of Concerns).

### Key Python Concepts Implemented

* **`for item in list`:** Iterates through every grade in the list.
* **`len()`:** Used to accurately determine the count of grades for the division step.
* **Parameters & Arguments:** Correctly passing the specific list (`math_grades`) into the function's generic parameter (`grades_list`).
